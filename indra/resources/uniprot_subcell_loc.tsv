Then, cytosol streams out of the cell body and inflates the newly formed bleb. Once expansion slows, an actin cortex is reconstituted. Retraction is powered by myosin motor proteins. Blebbing is a common feature of cell physiology during cell movement, cytokinesis, cell spreading and apoptosis.	Cellular component	bleb

SL-0035	The caveola is a small (apparently) uncoated pit mostly found in the cell membrane of many highly differentiated mammalian cells, such as adipocytes, endothelial cells and muscle cells. These flask-shaped invaginations are defined by the presence of caveolins and contains a subset of lipid-raft components, including cholesterol and sphingolipids. Caveolae each comprise a caveolar bulb with a diameter of 60-80 nm, connected to an opening of fairly constant diameter. Caveolae might exists as single pits or can form a cluster of caveolae with non-caveolar membrane between the pits. In many tissues, and particularly in adipocytes, multiple caveolae are arranged around a central vacuolar domain. In developing muscle fibres, multiple caveolae are connected by a single neck to the cell membrane, producing large chains of interconnected caveolae. Another structural feature of caveolae in certain endothelia is the presence of a stomatal diaphragm, which consists of a central density and radial spikes, in the neck of the caveolae. Mature caveolae might be assembled in the Golgi apparatus. Caveolae can flatten out into the cell membrane, thereby loosing their caveolar identity.	Cellular component	caveola

Cell walls of bacteria contain peptidoglycan while those of archaea are not made of peptidoglycan, but some archaea may contain pseudopeptidoglycan, which is composed of N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, instead of N-acetyl muramic acid in peptidoglycan. The plant cell wall is made of fibrils of cellulose embedded in a matrix of several other kinds of polymers such as pectin and lignin. Algal cell walls are usually composed of cellulose, glycoproteins, sporopollenin, calcium and various polysaccharides such as manosyl, xylanes, alginic acid.

Cellular component	clathrin-coated pit
SL-0070	Clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) mediate the vesicular transport of cargo such as proteins between organelles in the post-Golgi network connecting the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, lysosomes and the cell membrane. CCVs that bud from the cell membrane reveal a striking polyhedral pattern reminiscent of a fullerene which arises from the outermost protein in the coat, clathrin. Clathrin assembles from three-legged individual components called triskelions to form a polygonal lattice around the vesicle. Clathrin is a large heterohexameric protein complex composed of three heavy chains and three light chains. Clathrin molecules self-assemble together to make a spherical clathrin lattice structure, a polyhedron made of regular pentagons and hexagons. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. The connection of the clathrin scaffold to the membrane is mediated by clathrin adaptors, which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes.

SL-0072	Coated pits are regions of the donor membrane where the assembly of the vesicle coat take place. The coat assembles from soluble protomers such as coat protein complex-I and coat protein complex-II.

During the first steps of the vesicle-mediated membrane transport, coated pits are internalized to form coated vesicles which transport proteins between distinct membrane-bound organelles.

SL-0073	A contractile vacuole (CV) complex is a membrane-bound osmoregulatory organelle of fresh water and soil amoebae and protozoa which segregates excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, and expel it to the cell exterior, so that the cytosolic osmolarity is kept constant under a given osmotic condition. Depending on the organism, the CV complex (CVC) shows different degrees of specialization of its tubular and vesicular elements. In the most elaborate CVCs of certain ciliates, e.g. Paramecium, a central vacuole, the contractile vacuole or cisterna, is surrounded by radially oriented ampullae or radial arms. These ampullae are connected to a network of channels. Excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, is segregated by the radial arms and enters the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells (the fluid-filling phase). The vacuole then rounds (the rounding phase) and the radial arms sever from the vacuole. The vacuole membrane then fuses with the plasma membrane at the pore region and the pore opens. The vacuole shrinks as its fluid is discharged through the pore (the fluid-discharging phase). The pore closes when the fluid has been discharged. The radial arms then reattach to the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells again as the fluid enters from the arms (the next fluid-filling phase).	Cellular component	Contractile vacuole

In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi is a polarized structure with, in most higher eukaryotic cells, a cis-face associated with a tubular reticular network of membranes facing the endoplasmic reticulum, the cis-Golgi network (CGN), a medial area of disk-shaped flattened cisternae, and a trans-face associated with another tubular reticular membrane network, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) directed toward the plasma membrane and compartments of the endocytic pathway.

SL-0431	The host is any organism in which another organism, or symbiont, spends part or all of its life cycle. Most animals and plants live symbiotically with microorganisms. The larger organism is called the host and smaller organism the symbiont. When the interactions between the symbiont and the host benefits both partners, the symbiotic interaction is called mutualism. When there is a negative effect on one of the partners, it is called a parasitic symbiosis and if there is no beneficial or negative effect it is a commensal symbiosis. These clear-cut definitions are not always easy to apply in nature. Take the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa for example. This bacterium can be found on the skin of humans and not cause disease, perhaps we would call it a commensial, but if the person has a severe burn P. aeruginosa can cause an infection and becomes a pathogen (a medicinal term for parasitism). This type of organism is called an opportunistic pathogen. Whether an association is a mutualist, commensal or parasitic depends on the relative "strengths" of the partners and the balance of power can change over time.	Cellular component	Host

SL-0188	The nucleolus is a dark, dense, roughly spherical area of fibers and granules in the nucleus. Only plant and animal nuclei contain one or more nucleoli, although some do not. No membrane separates the nucleolus from the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus mediates the ribosomal RNA biogenesis. It is organized from the "nucleolar organizing regions" on a number of different chromosomes which cluster and transcribe ribosomal RNA. These regions are seen as circular areas surrounded by a rim of electron dense filaments, collectively called the pars fibrosa (PF), which are formed from newly transcribed ribosomal RNA. PF then link to proteins and leads to accumulation of ribonucleoprotein particles in the pars granulosa (PG). These particles form the large and small ribosomal subunits which are then transported out of the nuclear pores separately. The pores do not accommodate the assembled ribosomes, therefore, they cannot reenter.	Cellular component	nucleolus

Speckles appear, at the immunofluorescence-microscope level, as irregular, punctuate structures, which vary in size and shape. Usually 25-50 speckles are observed per interphase mammalian nucleus. At the electronic-microscope level, they are composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called interchromatin granules clusters (IGCs). Speckles are dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell.

SL-0192	The paranodal septate junction (PSJ) in vertebrate species is an occluding complex which occurs between neurons and the glial cells that myelinate them, the oligodendrocytes and the Schwann cells. Each glial cell wraps around and contacts the neuron multiple times in a spiral pattern to form the paranodal loops. The paranodal loops tightly adhere to the axon through a continuous spiral of axo-glial junctions that resemble invertebrate septate junctions (SJs). The paranodal loops are a spiraled cytoplasmic channel that is contiguous with the perikaryon of the myelin forming cell and thus can serve as a conduit for transmitting axonally induced signals that could regulate glial gene transcription. These junctions also form a physical barrier that prevents diffusion of nodal sodium channels and juxtaparanodal potassium channels.

In the spore, the polar tube is connected at the anterior end, and then coils around the sporoplasm. Upon appropriate environmental stimulation, the polar tube rapidly discharges out of the spore, pierces a cell membrane and serves as a conduit for sporoplasm passage into the new host cell.	Cellular component	Spore polar tube
SL-0254	Protein found in the spore wall. The spore wall is the main element of the spore's resistance to environmental stress. It is usually composed of several layers of different sugar polymers like mannans and glucans which are associated to glycoproteins. The composition, structure and number of layers are very different between bacteria, plants, protozoans or fungi.	Cellular component	Spore wall
SL-0302	The stereocilium is a finger-like projection forming the hair bundle on the apical surface of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. Stereocilia stiffness and function depend on the several hundreds of uniformly polarized and tightly cross-linked actin filaments. Stereocilia cytoskeleton shows continuous turnover with actin filament assembly occuring at the stereocilium tip and its disassembly at the base so that stereocilium length is maintained in a dynamic steady-state. This staircase-like bundle of stereocilia is responsible for mechanosensation and ultimately the perception of sound.	Cellular component	stereocilium
SL-0303	The stereocilium membrane is the portion of the cell membrane surrounding a stereocilium.	Cellular component	stereocilium membrane

SL-0256	Symbiosis lead to the formation of a new compartment in the plant cell when bacteria enter the plant cell by endocytosis, the symbiosome. This compartment harbours the bacteroids surrounded by a peribacteroid membrane (PMB) originating from the plant plasma membrane. The space between this membrane and the bacteroid membrane is called the peribacteroid space.	Cellular component	Symbiosome

SL-0258	Synapses are the communicating cell-cell junctions that allow signals to pass from a nerve cell to a target cell. In a chemical synapse, the signal is carried by a neurotransmitter which diffuses across a narrow synaptic cleft and activates a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane of the target cell. The target may be a dendrite, cell body, neuronal axon, a specialized region of a muscle or a secretory cell. In an electrical synapse, a direct connection is made between the cytoplasms of two cells via gap junctions.	Cellular component	synapse
SL-0259	The synaptic vesicles mediate the exocytosis of neurotransmitter and the endocytosis of vesicular components being such a crutial element in the maintenance of synaptic transmission in the nervous system.	Cellular component	synaptic vesicle

SL-0452	A target membrane is a lipid bilayer which surrounds target cell enclosed spaces and compartments. This selectively permeable structure is essential for effective separation of a target cell or target cell organelle from its surroundings. This term is used to describe a toxin located to a membrane of a target cell.	Cellular component	Target membrane
SL-0263	The tegument of schistosomes is an outer-surface covering blood-dwelling flatworms. This unique structure consists of a double phospholipid bilayer (also known as the heptalaminar outer-surface structure) that ovelay a syncytium of fused cells surrounding the entire worm. These outer-tegumental membranes form many surface pits that substantially increase the surface area of the schistosome. The underlying syncytial-matrix contains some mitochondria, many vesicular structures and an extensive cytoskeleton. A basal lamina separates the syncytium from a layer of muscle cells. Nuclei and ribosomes are located in cytons, which are located underneath the muscle layer and connected by microtubule-lined cytoplasmic connections.	Cellular component	Tegument
SL-0264	The membrane suroounding the tegument of schistosomes.	Cellular component	Tegument membrane
SL-0276	The telomere is a nucleoprotein structure comprising the terminal section of a eukaryotic chromosome. It has a specialized structure which is replicated by a special process, thereby counteracting the tendency of a chromosome to be shortened during each round of replication.	Cellular component	telomere
SL-0450	The thylakoid is a membranous cellular structure containing the photosynthetic pigments, reaction centers and electron-transport chain. In chloroplast, thylakoids stack up to form the grana or stay as single cisternae and interconnect the grana. Thylakoid, where photosynthesis occurs, are found in chloroplasts, cyanelles and in photosynthetic bacteria where they are the extensive invaginations of the plasma membrane.	Cellular component	Thylakoid
SL-0265	The tight junction (TJ) is a dynamic, multifunctional complex which, together with adherens junctions and desmosomes, maintains the integrity of the epithelial cell layer(s) that protects multicellular organisms. TJ is located at the apical-most portion of the intercellular junction. It separates the apical and basolateral compartments of epithelia (preventing the lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins between the apical and basolateral domains of plasma membrane) and plays a key role in limiting paracellular permeability to ions and solutes in a charge and size selective manner. TJs appear as multiple strands of fibrils forming a continuous circumferential seal around cells.	Cellular component	tight junction
SL-0266	The trans-Golgi network is a highly dynamic series of interconnected tubules and vesicles at the trans face of the Golgi stack. The trans-Golgi network functions in the processing and sorting of glycoproteins and glycolipids at the interface of the biosynthetic and endosomal pathways. The generation and maintenance of apical and basolateral membranes rely on sorting events that occur in the TGN.	Cellular component	trans-Golgi network

SL-0268	The trichocyst is an architecturally complex secretory granule having a highly constrained shape docked at specialized cortical sites in Paramecium and other ciliates. Each cell bears about 1'000 trichocysts, which are supposed to be defensive organelles against predators. Trichocyst consists of a spindle-shaped body bearing at its wide end a tip often compared to an inverted golf tee. An external stimulus can trigger massive and synchronous exocytosis. After exocytotic membrane fusion, contact with the H2O and calcium ions in the external medium leads to an extremely rapid (< 50 ms) and irreversible expansion of the trichocyst contents, to yield a second, needle-shaped form which remains insoluble.	Cellular component	Trichocyst

Cellular component	uropodium
SL-0272	The vacuole is a generally large fluid-filled membrane-bound compartment in the cytoplasm. The precise form and function of vacuoles may vary between phyla. Plant vacuoles are among the best characterized. They differ in terms of their lumenal contents and processing enzymes, as well as on the basis of the type of integral proteins in their membranes (tonoplast intrinsic proteins, TIPs). Examples include the lytic vacuole, the storage vacuole and the lutoid. One important function of plant vacuoles is the maintenance of hydrostatic pressure. Other eukaryotes employ vacuoles for a variety of purposes, including storage (as in the yeast lysosome/vacuole), secretion and phagocytosis. In Protozoa, contractile vacuoles can be used to discharge water from the cytoplasm to the external environment. Aquatic microorganisms may employ gas vacuoles (composed of clusters of inert gas vesicles) to provide buoyancy.	Cellular component	Vacuole

SL-0314	Z-disks are the lateral boundaries of a single sarcomere. In electron micrographs of cross striated muscle the Z line appears as a series of dark lines. They represent a key interface between the contractile apparatus and the cytoskeleton. The Z line (from the German "Zwischen") largely consists of alpha-actinin homodimers organized in an antiparallel fashion, thereby providing a backbone for the insertions of actin-based thin filaments, as well as titin and nebulin/nebulette. Z line of neighbouring sarcomeres are aligned in parallel and connected via the intermediate filament protein desmin. They maintain the actin filaments in a tetragonal lattice.	Cellular component	Z line
