Processors for knowledge input (:py:mod:`indra.sources`)
========================================================

INDRA interfaces with and draws knowledge from many sources including
reading systems (some that extract biological mechanisms, and some that extract
general causal interactions from text) and also from structured databases,
which are typically human-curated or derived from experimental data.
